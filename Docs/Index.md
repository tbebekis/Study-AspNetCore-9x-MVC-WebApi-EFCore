# A study on Asp.Net Core 9.x MVC, WebApi and Entity Framework Core
 
This documentation folder contains a group of texts describing 

- Asp.Net Core MVC and 
- Asp.Net Core WebApi 

with the use of the Entity Framework Core.

## The projects
In addition to the texts, the solution includes two, fully functioning, main projects

- an MVC application and
- a WebApi application

The projects are Asp.Net Core 9.x projects. 

Perhaps they can be used with later Asp.Net Core versions and some earlier too.

Both these projects may be used as template projects. Just copy a project to a proper folder, change some project names and start adding Controllers and Views.
 
Both projects can also serve as a playground for experimentation.

## The texts

The texts in this folder are just describing some Asp.Net Core fundamentals. They are not meant to be exhausting or to cover the whole Asp.Net Core, but notheless they offer a good starting point.

Texts are organized in three groups

- **Asp.Net Core**. Covers the common aspects.
- **Asp.Net Core MVC**. Covers aspects pertinent to MVC.
- **Asp.Net Core WebApi**. Covers aspects pertinent to WebApi.
