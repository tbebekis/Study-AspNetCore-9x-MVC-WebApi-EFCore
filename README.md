This solution is a study on Asp.Net Core and Entity Framework Core. 

The solution contains documentation texts found in the [Docs](Docs/Index.md) folder and two projects

The documentation texts and the accompanying projects cover a large number of Asp.Net Core aspects. 

Some of them are

- Configuration
- Dependency Injection
- Middlewares
- Authentication (Cookie and JWT)
- Authorization
- Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
- Localization
- Logging with a custom Logging Provider
- Model Binding
- Json Serialization
- Session state management
- File Providers
- Tag Helpers
- Themes
- Dynamically-loaded MVC Plugins
- Filters
- Global Error Handling
- Caching
- Object Mapping
- Health Checks
- Paging
- EF Core Generic Data Service
- Ajax Request Handling
- Custom Attributes

> The two projects are fully functioning.
